### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs greatly helped in preparing me to complete the assignment. Specifically, learning about working with APIs was incredibly valuable as it provided me with the necessary knowledge and skills to fetch data and incorporate it into the project. However, there were certain aspects of the assignment that I initially felt unprepared for. For instance, dynamically loading more results and creating an aesthetically pleasing interface presented challenges. To overcome these hurdles, I dedicated extra time to self-study,research, also the Lab videos and asking questions from my instructor. This allowed me to delve deeper into concepts such as asynchronous operations and design principles. Through perseverance and additional efforts, I successfully completed the assignment. Overall, the labs served as a solid foundation, and with my own determination, I was able to accomplish the task at hand.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would have loved to include extra features and take my time to incorporate more engaging animations. Additionally, I would have made an effort to learn and explore new things to enhance my project even further

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, I think everything went smoothly with my project. However, I do wish I had been able to successfully implement the popup feature and properly integrate the trailer or embedded YouTube video. It would have added an extra level of interactivity and enhanced the user experience. Despite that, I'm satisfied with the progress I made."
